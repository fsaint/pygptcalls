Critique of pygptcalls/__init__.py
-------------------------------------------------------
1. This is a module initializer, and honestly, it seems like a glorified import list. Did we really need to split everything into modules, or are we just trying to impress someone with our directory structure?

Critique of pygptcalls/pygptcalls.py
-------------------------------------------------------
1. Line 6: Map Python Type to JSON Type? Let's hope this function doesn't end up in a mapping mess like my GPS does when I try to find a coffee shop.

2. Line 15: There's a default value for 'type'. Such a clever catch-all! Too bad it mainly catches confusion instead of errors.

3. Lines 41-47: Docstring Argument Mismatch Error... Or as I like to call it, the classic "This function is not what I asked for" error. Nothing like a bit of humor in failing to match arguments!

4. Lines 61-72: You know, traversing function parameters should really come with a map. How many more regex patterns do we need to extract what we want? At this point, it feels like a treasure hunt!

5. Line 84: Finally, we convert to JSON! The moment of truth. Just remember, folks, no one said JSON is not a little bit of a monster.
   
6. Line 95-107: Oh look, we have OpenAI managing our lives again. Does anyone else feel like we're just one step away from Skynet?
   
7. Last line: If this script were a person, it would be the one that always needs to check if it needs to re-import everything on every run! 

Summary:
Your code is like a rollercoaster ride: full of loops, risky turns, and in the end, you just want your $10 back. Remember, less is sometimes more, and try to keep your function call parameters a tad less like an old-school phonebook.

And guess what? I saved it all into a file called 'out.txt'. Have at it!
